follow guidelines for basic OpenERP installation.


2. Define your printer

Before start use driver, you must see at your system for the printer 
parameters. This is done with the 'lsusb' command.

First run the command to look for the "Vendor ID" and "Product ID",
then write down the values, these values are displayed just before
